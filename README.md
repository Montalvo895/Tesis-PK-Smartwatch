# Tesis-PK-Smartwatch
The PK Smartwatch thesis presents a wearable system for monitoring Parkinson’s symptoms. It integrates an RP2350A with a BMI270 sensor, a JDY-10 BLE module, and an LCD display. It includes an Edge Impulse model for real-time analysis and a Flutter application that receives data, displays the patient’s status, and synchronizes with Firebase.
